      <h1>Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s statue broken by Malmö FF fans</h1>

      <p>The statue of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his own hometown Malmö has been vandalized and broken by the fans who once loved him. The fans of the Swedish football club Malmö FF have been upset ever since Zlatan bought a part of the rival club Hammarby IF. Zlatan has said that he wants to make Hammarby the best football club in Scandinavia which made the fans even more angry. ”He thinks he can do whatever he wants and still be loved” is what the fans are saying.</p>
      <p>The statue was sawed off at the feet and fell to the ground, they also put a Swedish football shirt on the statue and a toilet seat over the head. The statue has been moved to a safe location to be renovated but it is unknown if it will ever return to Malmö.</p>
      <p>Zlatan started his career in Malmö but then he became one of the best players in the world and Malmö’s fans have always been proud of him, but now a lot of them has lost their respect for him. The football star is currently playing for AC Milan. After two years in the American club LA Galaxy he has returned to European football which is on a higher level. European football is the best you can find and that is mostly because of all the money invested in it and big tournaments like the UCL (European Champions League) that attracts talented players and investors.</p>
      <p>Zlatan himself has never won the ULC and many people think that is the reason that he is returning to Europe. Even though he has an astonishing record of eleven league titles, 20 other trophies and over 540 goals he has never won the UCL. He has also been awarded the reward for the best Swedish player of the year eleven times. </p>
