      <h1>The Weather</h1>
        <h2>This weeks weather</h2>
          <p>The coming week will be full of ups and downs when it comes to the weather, you will see everything from shining sun to cloud filled skies and rain pouring down. Now let's go through the weeks weather day by day</p>

        <h2>Monday</h2>
          <p>The day will start of really cold with a chilling temperature of approximately  2 degrees and frost on the ground. The sky will be covered with clouds all morning and no sunshine will slip through. Some northern winds are going to contribute to the cold temperature so I recommend that you put on a warm jacket. But don’t be too mad at the winds, later on around 12 o'clock they will blow away a lot of the clouds and the sun will shine down on us which will make it feel like around 5 degrees. This nice weather will hold until about 5 o'clock and after that the dark will start to roll in as the sun goes down. It will be a cold evening and the temperature is going to drop below 0 degrees and it might even snow during the night.</p>
        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
          <p>Good morning! Today the ground is covered with snow and we have a clear blue sky. The snow has been falling all night but it won't be here for long as temperatures are expected to rise to about 4 degrees before midday. Some southern winds are coming in and they will melt the snow so it might get slushy, I recommend wearing boots today otherwise you will get wet freezing feet. If we’re lucky the sky will stay clear all day but the risk is that some clouds will be coming in with the winds and if that is the case then a rainy evening is very possible. </p>
        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
          <p>Good morning! The rain has been falling all night and is still pouring down. If you’re planning on being outside for more than 5 minutes I recommend you wear boots, a rain jacket and an umbrella. You won't feel much wind today and the temperature will vary between 4-6 degrees until midday when they will probably rise to around 7 degrees. The sight of a rainbow will be highly unlikely as the sun probably won't show all day as a thick layer of clouds cover the sky. Closer to the evening the rain will calm down but it won't stop falling down entirely until at least midnight.</p>
        <h2>Thursday</h2>
          <p>Today I bring wonderful news! The sun will be shining strong until midday and the sky will be pretty clear. Around 12 o'clock some clouds will roll in and stop some of the sunlight from getting through. Yesterday’s rain has completely dried up and  there won't be anymore raining today. Some cold winds will come in from the north and the temperature will be approximately 5 degrees. Closer to the evening the temperature will sink to about 3 degrees as the sun goes down and the dark takes over. We have gotten reports that the storm Margareta might be rolling in the coming days and it might hit us hard! I’ll keep you updated.</p>
        <h2>Friday</h2>
          <p>Good morning! Today’s weather is terrible as the storm Margareta has hit. There will be extreme amounts of strong winds blowing at a high speed all day long and the rain will pour down constantly. The rain might even cause floods in certain areas as we fear the there will be too much of it. The temperature will vary around 2-5 degrees but that may change during the day as it's nearly impossible to predikat this storm. If we’re lucky the storm might pass as early as tonight but it can also stick around for a couple more days. I recommend that you don’t go outside more than necessary today and if you happen to go outside, bring a raincoat.</p>
        <h2>Saturday</h2>
          <p>Good morning! The storm Margareta is still going and I recommend everybody stays inside today as multiple trees have fallen down blocking the roads and causing other trouble as well. The rain is still falling down but luckily there haven’t been any reported floods. Best case scenario is that the storm will be gone by tomorrow and we avoid floods and more trees being torn down by the strong winds. Today the temperature will be approximately 5 degrees but the winds will make it feel a lot colder.</p>
        <h2>Sunday</h2>
          <p>Today’s weather is splendid as the storm Margareta has passed by and the sun has finally come out from behind the clouds. The temperature will be 10 degrees all day long and it's the warmest day we’ve had in months and I think it's a sign that the spring is on the way. According to our reports there won't be anymore snowing this year as the temperature won't drop below zero until next winter.</p>
