      <h1>Kid Murderer</h1>
      <p>The boy was 12 years old when he got stabbed to death. This happened in Kortedala in Gothenburg and after 2 days in the hospital the young boy has tragically passed away. The boy got stabbed in the throat in the parking lot just by the school. After some intense searching the police found a suspect matching the crime. The shocking part is the young age of the perpetrator.</p>
      <p>They don’t want to go out with too much information because he was under 15 years old. He was found in his home and was under interrogation but what attitude he has to the crime the chamber prosecutor won’t comment. The investigation is conducted by the so called LUL 31 that is when the suspect is under the age of 15. The LUL 31 investigation are done to give the social services a basis when assessing what types of interventions the designation perpetrator needs.</p>
      <p>In Sweden it is uncommon that such a young boy gets murdered and in this case it even weirder because the murderer was also a little kid. In Sweden it’s becoming more and more common that younger people gets robbed. Maybe it’s because of how much valuables kids have on them these days. And when people get robbed they might not want to give their phones or clothes away so the robber has to use violence to get what they want. And maybe, maybe they kill the person. That’s maybe why the kid got killed but I don’t know, these are just speculations.</p>
