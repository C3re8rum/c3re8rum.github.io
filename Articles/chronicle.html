      <h1>On the terrible defeat</h1>

      <p>Barcelona lost 3-2 to Atletico Madrid on Thursday in a dramatic, entertaining game in the Spanish Super Cup. This means that the Atletico is going through to the final against Real Madrid on Saturday. This match was a big thing for Antoine Griezmann who faced his former club.</p>
      <h2>First half</h2>
      <p>The first half of the match was pretty boring with Barcelona having the better half with some shots at the goal. But Oblak was in an insane form for this match and saved everything. The only real attempt at the goal was when Griezmann tried to chip the goalkeeper. The first half ended 0-0. </p>
      <h2>Second half</h2>
      <p>Koke came on at half-time and put Atletico ahead straight from kick-off.  Took a pass from Correa and, rather stumbling as he shot, found the bottom-left corner from 15 yards.</p>
      <p>Atletico’s lead did not last long as Messi equalised five minutes later in the 51st minute, Suarez laying off to Messi who had a challenge against Stefan Savic on the edge of the penalty area before planting a powerful right-footed shot into the left corner.</p>
      <p>Messi thought he had put Barca ahead on the hour after controlling a high ball beautifully and curling it past Oblak only to see it disallowed by VAR for handball.</p>
      <p>Yet Barca kept on attacking and scored again when Griezmann headed it in after Oblak had blocked a thunderous Suarez header.</p>
      <p>VAR then chalked another Barcelona goal off after a clever free-kick. Messi chips the ball to Arturo Vidal who pass the ball to Gerard Pique with a volley. Then pique scored from close range, but it was disallowed for offside by Vidal.</p>
      <p>Atletico equalised from the penalty spot after Neto brought down Correa. Morata sent Neto  the wrong way to make it 2-2 with nine minutes of normal time remaining. Atletico wanted a second penalty when Morata's cross hit Pique's right hand moments later and they looked to have a case but this time VAR said no.</p>
      <p>It didn’t really matter though because Barcelona conceded again when Correa raced through and shot at Neto. The goalkeeper got two hands to the ball but it looped over him and bounced into the goal despite Sergio Roberto’s attempts to hook it clear. The game finished 3-2 in favor of Atlético.</p>

      <h2>My thoughts on the game and on the future of Barcelona</h2>
      <p>I reckon the game didn’t live up to the expectations. The first 45 min of the game there was little chances and Barcelona played their normal playstile. Barcelona passed the ball side to side forward and backwards but didn’t have any chances. I thought that this was boring because Atlético played low defense as always and tried to counterattack. This two playing stiles didn’t work well with each other if you wanted a game with fast tempo and lots of chances and goals.</p>
      <p>A big talking point was when the young wonderkid from atlètico Joao Felix and for many people the goat  (greatest of all time) of the game Lionel Messi had an argument and it was becoming very intense before their teammates came. Joao Felix was in an argument before that incident with Barcelona legend Jordi Alba so I think Joao have to respect the older players more and just walk away.</p>
      <p>Another thing was the Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde have been very bad in some people’s eyes and that almost every Barcelona fan wanted him out of the club. We now know it happened after this match and that Barcelona talked with Xavi about the job. The Barca legend turned the job down as he didn’t think he was ready for it. There were rumors that Barca was going to bring AFC Ajax coach Erik ten Hag to be the next coach of Barcelona.</p>
      <p>All these rumors and speculations are now ended as Barcelona have a new coch and his name is Quique Setién. The former Real Betis coach have been given the opportunity to takeover Barcelona and make them the best team in Europe.</p>
      <p>I think this will be great for Barcelona they will get back to some of that glory they had back in the days when they were almost unbeatable. They will pass the ball like they used to under Pep Guardiola. </p>
